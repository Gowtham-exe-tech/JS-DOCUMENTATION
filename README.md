# JAVASCRIPT

* A high-level (relatively far away from machine's hardware, closer to human thinking)

* Dynamically typed (no need to explicitly declare the variable's type, it can hold different types at different times.)

* Interpreted :

    - Modern JIT Introduction(Just-In-Time compilation)

*Note:* **Hot Code** a code that gets execute frequently.

* JIT helps when there is a hot code, it optimize it, executes faster.

* Modern JavaScript engines use a combination of interpretation/execution and JIT compilation/optimization.

# Why JS was created?

* Web pages are static, If we wanted something to change, we generally needed another request to the server.

* JavaScript was introduced to allow the browser to execute code locally and make web pages more interactive

# JS Engine

* chrome - node.js = v8 engine

* V8 is Google's JavaScript engine.

# Console.log()

* Where to use:
    Debugging
    Checking Function execution
    Inspecting data
    Understand program flow while developing

* Where no to use :
    Passwords
    Access tokens
    API keys
    Private personal information

# Comments

* Single-line comment `//comment line`

* Multi-line Comment `/* multi-line comment */`

* Use comments to explain:
    - why something unusual exists
    - business rules  
    - constraints
    - workarounds
    - non-obvious decisions

# `<script>` Tag

* The `<script>` tag is used to load or write JavaScript in HTML.

## Where to place it?

* `<head>`

`<script src="app.js" defer></script>`

* `<body>`

`<script src="app.js"></script>`

### `defer`

`defer` tells the browser to:

1. Download JavaScript while HTML is being parsed.
2. Continue parsing HTML without blocking it.
3. Execute JavaScript after HTML parsing is complete.

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

### Script loading


* Normal:
HTML parsing → STOP → download JS → execute JS → continue HTML

* defer:
HTML parsing + download JS → HTML parsing complete → execute JS

* async:
HTML parsing + download JS → download complete → execute immediately

**note:** `defer` means **after HTML parsing**, not "after the page is fully rendered"

# Js not purely object-oriented language

* js is fundamentally prototype-based.
* objects can exist without defining a class
* js objects can inherit behavior from another object through prototype chain. 

* **note** : A prototype is another object that JavaScript looks at when the current object doesn't have the property or method you're asking for.

## property shadowing

Javascript searches from the object upward, it doesn't continue searching once it finds the property

admin
 └── name = "Admin" ← FOUND
       ↑
       STOP

user
 └── name = "User"


# Variables 

*  A name binding/ referenceto a value

* EG: `let age = 21;`

## Variable Declaration

* var, let, const -> don't treat as equally preferred.

**const**

* use when the variable binding should not be reassigned *constant*

```js
const name = "jay";
name = "Riy";
console.log(name);
```

Here the error will occur: *TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.*

* **Use-case:** Application API endpoint `const API_URL = "https://example.com/api";`

**let**

* Use when variable needs to be reassigned.

Eg: 
```js
let name = "Gowtham";
name = "Priya";
console.log(name);
```

* **Use-case:** Shopping cart quantity changes
```js
let quantity = 1;
quantity = quantity + 1;
```

**var**

* In older javascript `var` can reassign a value to variable.

* `var` and `let` differ in **Scope behaviour**

Eg: 
```js
if (true) {
    var x = 10; // function scoped
    let y = 20; //block scoped
}

console.log(x);//accessible outisde the if block
console.log(y);//not accessible outside the if block Reference error
```

**why function block  var is problem**

* easy for variables to escape the block where they logically belong.

```js
function processOrders(orders) {
    for (var i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {
        // process order
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    // process customers
    }

    console.log(i);
}
```
here `i` is still available for custoer process cause a logical bug.

* Affects scope containment(nested codes)

* Easier to accidentally share/reuse

# Data Types

# JavaScript Data Types

A data type defines **what kind of value** a variable holds.

JavaScript has **7 primitive data types**:

## 1. String

Used to store text.

```js
const name = "Gowtham";
const city = 'Coimbatore';
```

## 2. Number

Used for integers and decimal numbers.

```js
const age = 21;
const price = 499.99;
```

JavaScript uses `Number` for both integers and floating-point values.

## 3. Boolean

Represents either `true` or `false`.

```js
const isLoggedIn = true;
const isAdmin = false;
```

Commonly used in conditions and decision-making.

## 4. Undefined

A variable exists but has not been assigned a value.

```js
let username;

console.log(username); // undefined
```

Real use:
- a variable hasn't received a value
- an object property doesn't exist
- a function doesn't return a value
- an API response doesn't contain an expected field

## 5. Null

Represents an **intentional absence of a value**.

```js
let selectedUser = null;
```

null → intentionally no value

```js
typeof null; // "object"
```

## 6. BigInt

Used for very large integers that cannot be safely represented by `Number`.

```js
const largeNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

The `n` at the end indicates a BigInt.

Use it only when large-integer precision is actually required.

## 7. Symbol

Creates a **unique value**.

```js
const id1 = Symbol("id");
const id2 = Symbol("id");

console.log(id1 === id2); // false
```

Even with the same description, each Symbol is unique.

Mostly used for advanced object/property use cases.

# Object

Objects are **not primitive values**.

They are used to store collections of related data.

It allows to store data and behavior together

```js
const user = {
    id: 101,
    name: "Gowtham",
    email: "gowtham@example.com",
    role: "developer"
};
```

* Arrays and functions are also objects in JavaScript's type system.

# Checking Data Type

Use `typeof`:

```js
typeof "Hello";     // "string"
typeof 100;         // "number"
typeof true;        // "boolean"
typeof undefined;   // "undefined"
typeof 100n;        // "bigint"
typeof Symbol();    // "symbol"
typeof {};          // "object"
typeof null;        // "object"
```
# Operators

Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.

`+` Addition
`-` Subtraction
`*` Multiplication
`/` Division
`%` Modulus (remainder)
`**` Exponentiation
`++` Increment
`--` Decrement

Ex:
```js
let a = 10;
let b = 3;

console.log(a + b); // 13
console.log(a % b); // 1
console.log(a ** b); // 1000
```

**Use-case:** Used for calculations like price calculation, quantity, marks, percentage, counters etc.

*Note:* `/` returns a number and can return decimal values.
```js
console.log(10 / 3); // 3.3333333333333335
```

**post increment/decrement [ x++/x-- ]** : use current first then increase/decrease value

**pre increment/decrement [ ++x/--x ]** : first increase/decrease value then use it.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign or update a value in a variable.

`= , += , -=, *= , /= , %= `

Ex:
```js
let amount = 100;

amount += 50;
console.log(amount); // 150
```

**Use-case:** Used when a variable's value needs to be updated based on its current value.

Instead of: `amount = amount + 50;`

we can write: `amount += 50;`

**OR ASSIGNENT '||='** 
```js
let username = "";
username ||= "Guest";
```
- here, if username is falsy then guest will get assigned.

**Nullish assignment '??='**

```js
let username = null;
username ??= "Guest";
console.log(username); // Guest
```

* use when we want a default only when the value is null or undefined.

* use ??= when no value provided, use ||= when value is falsy needed a fallback

* use &&= when we need only fasly value, no true value.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (`true` or `false`).
```text
==     Equal
===    Strictly equal
!=     Not equal
!==    Strictly not equal
>      Greater than
<      Less than
>=     Greater than or equal
<=     Less than or equal
```

```js
const age = 21;

console.log(age >= 18); // true
console.log(age === 21); // true
```

**Use-case:** Used in conditions, validation, permissions, filtering data etc.

### `==` vs `===`

`==` compares values after allowing type conversion.

`===` compares both value and type without performing type conversion.

Ex:
```js
console.log(5 == "5");  // true implicit type coercion
console.log(5 === "5"); // false
```

*Note:* In modern JavaScript, prefer `===` and `!==` for predictable comparisons.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or reverse conditions.

`&&` AND
`||` OR
`!` NOT

Ex:
```js
const age = 21;
const hasID = true;

console.log(age >= 18 && hasID); // true
```

`&&` returns true only when both conditions are true.

IN ADMIN PAGE:
```js
const isLoggedIn = true;
const isAdmin = true;

if (isLoggedIn && isAdmin) {
    console.log("Show admin dashboard");
}
```

`||` returns true when at least one condition is true.

```js
let isAdmin = false;
let isManager = true;

if (isAdmin || isManager) { //true
    console.log("Can approve");
}
```

`!` reverses the Boolean result.
```js
if (!isLoggedIn) {
    console.log("Redirect to login");
}
```

Ex:
```js
console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
```

**Use-case:** Used when a decision depends on multiple conditions.


**Why we use it:** To create more complex conditions without writing separate `if` statements.

*Note:* `&&` and `||` also work with non-Boolean values and return one of the operands. This becomes important when working with default values and short-circuiting.

* JavaScript uses **truthiness** to determine which value to return.

* `&&` returns the **first falsy value**, or the last value if everything is truthy.

* `||` returns the first truthy value.

* JavaScript can stop evaluating once the result is already known called **short-circuiting**

## Bitwise Operators

* Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representation of numbers.

* Bitwise operators work on the individual binary bits of a number.

`&` AND
`|` OR
`^` XOR
`~` NOT
`<<` Left shift
`>>` Right shift

Ex:
```js
const a = 5; // 101
const b = 3; // 011

console.log(a & b); // 1

console.log(5<<1) //10 normally left shift multiple by 2
console.log(20>>1) //10 normally right shift divides by 2
```

**Use-case:** Used in low-level operations, bit flags, permissions and some performance-sensitive operations.

* User permission on READ, Write, Delete like that 
    Read = 1<<0   //0001
    Write = 1<<1  //0010
    Delete = 1<<2 //0100
    user = Read | Write //0011

    if (user & read){ // 0011 & 0001 = 0001 true 
        code to execute
    }

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a short way to write a simple `if...else` condition.

Syntax:

`condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`

Eg:

```js
const isLoggedIn = true;
const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back" : "Please login";
console.log(message);
```

**Use-case:** Used when a simple condition needs to produce **one of two values**

*Do not use nested or complicated ternary expressions because they become difficult to read. Use `if...else` when the logic is more complex.*

# Control Flow

Control flow means controlling which parts of your JavaScript code should execute and when.

## `if`

`if` executes a block of code when a condition is true.

Eg:

```js
if (amount > 10000) {
    requireManagerApproval();
}
```

**Use-case:** Used when a piece of code should execute only when a specific condition is satisfied.

## `else`

`else` executes when the `if` condition is false.

Ex:
```js
const isLoggedIn = false;

if (isLoggedIn) {
    console.log("Show dashboard");
} else {
    console.log("Show login page");
}
```

## `else if`

`else if` is used when there are multiple conditions that need to be checked.

Put more specific / higher-priority conditions before broader ones(Order Matters)

Ex: Expense approval
```js
const amount = 15000;

if (amount <= 5000) {
    console.log("Accounts approval");
} else if (amount <= 10000) {
    console.log("Manager approval");
} else {
    console.log("MD approval");
}
```
* Used when the program needs to select one path from multiple possible conditions.

* JavaScript checks the conditions from top to bottom and executes the first matching block.

**Note** the conditions doesn't require to be true or false, 
            false
            0
            ""
            null
            undefined
            NaN
        The above mentioned are falsy other than that almost everything is falsy.

```js
if (username) {
    console.log("Username exists");
}

//alternative
if (username !== "") {
    console.log("Username exists");
}
```

* Ternary is better when we choose between two values
* if..else is better when we perform actions based on condition.

## `switch` (=== strict matching)

`switch` is used to execute different code based on the value of an expression.

It is used when we want to compare **one value against multiple exact values.**

Ex:

```js
const status = "approved";

switch (status) {
    case "pending":
        console.log("Waiting for approval");
        break;

    case "approved":
        console.log("Approved");
        break;

    case "rejected":
        console.log("Rejected");
        break;

    default:
        console.log("Unknown status");
}
```

**Use-case:** Useful when one value needs to be compared against several known fixed values.

*`break` prevents execution from continuing into the next case. fall-through*

*`default` executes when no case matches.*

# Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is satisfied.

## `for` Loop

The `for` loop is commonly used when the number of iterations or loop structure is known.

Ex: **The iteration is the main idea**
    Receive orders:
```js
    const orders = [
        { id: 101, amount: 500 },
        { id: 102, amount: 1200 },
        { id: 103, amount: 800 }
    ];

    let total = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {
        total += orders[i].amount;
    }
    // Here, for every order we need to do something repeatedly
```

* Iterating through arrays, repeating an operation a known number of times, generating values etc.

* Use to avoid writing the same code repeatedly.

The three parts are:

`initialization` → runs once before the loop

`condition` → checked before every iteration

`update` → runs after every iteration

## `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes code as long as the condition is true.

Example: **Keep doing this as long as this condition is true/ untill it becomes false**

```js
const queue = ["Order A", "Order B", "Order C"];

function processItem(item) {
    console.log("Processing:", item);
}

while (queue.length > 0) {
    const item = queue.shift();

    processItem(item);
}
// here, the logic is keep processing while there are items in queue
```

* Useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.

* Make sure the condition eventually becomes false, otherwise it can create an infinite loop.

## `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop executes the code at least once before checking the condition.

Example:
```js
let choice;

do {
    showMenu();
    choice = getUserChoice();

    handleChoice(choice);

} while (choice !== 4);

// Show and process the menu, then continue until the user chooses 4
```

* Useful when the operation must happen at least once before checking the condition.

Example: Asking a user for input at least once.

* Difference from `while`: `while` checks first, `do...while` executes first.

## `break`

`break` immediately exits the loop or `switch`.

Ex:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }

    console.log(i);
}
```

Output stops at `4`.

* Used when the required result has already been found and continuing the loop is unnecessary.

## `continue`

`continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

Ex:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        continue;
    }

    console.log(i);
}
```

The value `2` is skipped.

* Used when certain items should be ignored while the loop continues processing the remaining items.

## `for...in`

`for...in` iterates over the enumerable property keys of an object.

Example:

```js
const user = {
    name: "Gowtham",
    age: 21
};

for (const key in user) {
    console.log(key);
}
```

* Mainly used for iterating over object properties.

* Do not normally use `for...in` to iterate through arrays because it iterates over keys/properties rather than array values.

## `for...of`

`for...of` iterates over the values of an iterable such as an array or string.

Eg:
```js
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];

for (const number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
}
```

* Useful when you need each value from an array or another iterable.

* It provides a clean way to process values without manually managing an index.

*`for...in` → keys/properties*

*`for...of` → values*

# Functions

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Ex:
```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

greet();
```

* Used to organize logic into reusable units such as validation, calculations, API processing etc.

* Avoids repeating code and makes the application easier to maintain.

## Function Declaration

A function declaration defines a named function using the `function` keyword.

eg:
```js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Parameters

Parameters are variables defined in a function that receive values when the function is called.

eg:
```js
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greet("Gowtham");
```

Here `name` is a parameter and `"Gowtham"` is an argument.

## Return

`return` sends a value back from the function and stops that function's execution.

ex:
```js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const result = add(10, 20);
```

* Used when a function needs to produce a result that another part of the application can use.

* If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns `undefined`.

## Function Expression

A function expression stores a function in a variable.

eg:
```js
const greet = function () {
    console.log("Hello");
};

greet();
```
* Useful when functions need to be stored in variables, passed as arguments or used as callbacks.

## Arrow Function

An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions.

Example:
```js
const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
};
```

For a single expression, it can be shortened further:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

* Commonly used for callbacks and short functions.

Ex:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

numbers.map(number => number * 2);
```

* Arrow functions have different `this` behavior from normal functions. This becomes important when we study the `this` keyword.

## Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior where declarations are processed before the code in their execution scope runs.

Ex:
```js
greet();

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
```

* This works because function declarations are hoisted.

But:

```js
greet();

const greet = () => {
    console.log("Hello");
};
```

This does not work because the variable is not initialized before it is accessed.

* Do not think of hoisting as JavaScript literally moving your code to the top. It is better to understand it as part of how declarations are created during execution setup.

# Scope & Closures

Scope determines **where a variable can be accessed in the code**.

## Global Scope

A variable declared in the global scope can generally be accessed from code that is within that global environment.
eg:
```js
const appName = "Expense App";

function showAppName() {
    console.log(appName);
}
```
* Global values can be useful when something genuinely needs application-wide access.

* Avoid creating unnecessary global variables because they can be changed or accessed from many places, making the code harder to maintain.

## Local Scope

A variable declared inside a function is available only within that function.

Ex:
```js
function login() {
    const username = "Gowtham";

    console.log(username);
}
```

`username` cannot be directly accessed outside the function.

* Used to keep variables limited to the part of the application where they are required.
* Reduces accidental changes and prevents unnecessary variables from being accessible everywhere.

## Block Scope

Variables declared using `let` and `const` inside a block are available only inside that block.

Ex:
```js
if (true) {
    const message = "Hello";
    console.log(message);
}

console.log(message); // ReferenceError
```

* Useful for keeping variables limited to a specific `if`, `for`, `while` or other block.

* `let` and `const` are block scoped, while `var` is function scoped.

## Lexical Scope

Lexical scope means a function can access variables based on **where the function is written in the source code**, not where it is called.

Ex:
```js
const message = "Hello";

function outer() {
    const name = "Gowtham";

    function inner() {
        console.log(message);
        console.log(name);
    }

    inner();
}
```

* Here `inner()` can access variables from its own scope and the surrounding scope where it was defined.

* Lexical scope allows functions to work with variables from their surrounding environment.

## Variable Shadowing

Variable shadowing happens when an inner scope declares a variable with the same name as a variable in an outer scope.

Ex:
```js
const name = "Gowtham";

function showName() {
    const name = "Priya";

    console.log(name);
}

showName();
console.log(name);
```

Output:
```js
Priya
Gowtham
```

- The inner `name` shadows the outer `name` inside the function.

* Sometimes useful when a local variable represents the same concept as an outer variable, but unnecessary shadowing can make code confusing.

* The inner variable does not change the outer variable.

## Closure

A closure is created when a function remembers and can access variables from its surrounding lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

Ex:
```js
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function () {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();

console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
console.log(counter()); // 3
```

* Here the returned function still has access to `count` even though `createCounter()` has already finished.

* Closures are useful for maintaining private state, creating function factories, callbacks and encapsulating data.

* A closure allows a function to preserve access to required variables without exposing those variables directly.

* The closure does not store a copy of the variable each time. It maintains access to the variable from its lexical environment.

```js
function createUserSession(userId) {
    let sessionActive = true;

    return {
        isActive() {
            return sessionActive;
        },

        logout() {
            sessionActive = false;
        }
    };
}

const session = createUserSession(101);
console.log(session.isActive()); // true
session.logout();
console.log(session.isActive()); // false
```

* Here `sessionActive` cannot be directly accessed from outside, but the returned methods can access and modify it through the closure.

* Closures are powerful, but don't create unnecessary long-lived closures that keep large objects in memory. This can contribute to memory leaks when references are unintentionally retained.
